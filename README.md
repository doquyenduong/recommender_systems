# Music Recommender
A cooperative project of Quyen, Martin and Kirsten for the module "Recommender System" at HSLU.

## Project Source and Requirement

Recommender Systems for Deezer - a [kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsg17-online-phase/).
You form groups of two (maximum three) people to solve this task. Each group implements its own solutions (please take into account the recommendation methods presented in class) and answers the following 3 questions:

* What would you do to win this competition?
* What would you do to solve the problem that Deezer is interested in?
* Why might the two solutions not overlap or why they do?

Please reference any work or code you think is interesting; a report of about six pages in size 10 font is expected (it should be less than 10 pages - keep it short and important); a submission of your code is required

## Project Background

Deezer is a music streaming app offering more than 43 million tracks and is available in more than 180 countries

- Getting the music recommendation right is crucial to attract and retain customers
- Deezer’s music prediction engine uses collaborative filtering to provide a user with the music he/she wants to listen at the time he/she wants
- Deezer needs help to improve the accurancy of music prediction engine
- Deezer provides the data of ~8 million listening histories from c.a. 20’000 users as base for this

- Some key challenges:
How can we accurately predict whether the user would listen to the new track recommended to them (>30 seconds without clicking Next)?
What other factors need to be considered to develop an accurate and robust music recommendation system for their day-to-day business?

## Programming language & models used: 
* Python
* Classfication approach: Decision tree, KNN, Logistic regression, random forest, SVM
* Recommender system approach: keras deep learning, SVD, Matrix Factorization, non-personalise recommendation
